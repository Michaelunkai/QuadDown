`en.json` is the original language file. All other built-in languages
in QuadDown were generated from this file using Google Translate.
json-translator is used to mass-translate the English file into the
main languages listed below. You can check it out here:
https://github.com/mololab/json-translator

Built-in translated languages:

- Spanish (es)
- Chinese (Simplified) (zh-CN)
- Arabic (ar)
- Hindi (hi)
- Bengali (bn)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Russian (ru)
- Japanese (ja)
- Italian (it)
- German (de)
- French (fr)

QuadDown also supports 93 extra languages. These are not included by
default. Instead when you select a language in the app, QuadDown will
translate it locally on your computer using the same script and Google Translate.
You can read more about how that works here: https://QuadDown.app/docs/binary-tool/language-translator

Since every translation is based on the English file, accuracy isn’t perfect.
And because translations are regenerated whenever new UI text is added, manual
fixes would get overwritten so patching individual translation issues is not possible.
