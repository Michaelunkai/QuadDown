# Achievement System in QuadDown

This achievement system is based on [achievement-watcher](https://github.com/xan105/achievement-watcher) but has been heavily modified to integrate seamlessly with the QuadDown client.

## Modifications

The main modifications from the original achievement-watcher include:

- Removed the original notification handling system
- Integrated with QuadDown's own notification helper for a consistent user experience
- Streamlined the codebase to focus on core achievement tracking functionality

## Integration

The achievement system works in conjunction with QuadDown's notification helper to provide real-time achievement updates to users. This integration ensures a unified notification experience across the entire QuadDown platform.
